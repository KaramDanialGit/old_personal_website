    description: 'Hello! I\'m a fourth year Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My hobbies include playing guitar, reading, gaming, and learning about software. \n My favourite frameworks include React and Flutter since they\'re pretty intuitive. I enjoy anything ranging from mobile cross-platform app dev to C#-based hardware Human Machine Interfaces. In short, I\'m a cool guy who wants to develop cool things. My hobbies involve playing guitar, learning about space, drawing, and learning new coding frameworks',
